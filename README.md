# What-is-Cloud-Computing

## Definition

Cloud computing is a model that facilitates prevalent, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and services. This model allows for the rapid deployment and release of resources with minimal management effort, providing businesses with the flexibility and scalability required to flourish in ever-changing conditions.

## Key Characteristics

1. **On-Demand Self-Service:**
   Users can autonomously supply computing resources, such as server time and storage, without requiring direct interaction with service providers. This feature empowers businesses to scale their operations seamlessly based on demand.

2. **Broad Network Access:**
   Cloud capabilities are accessible over the network and can be utilized through standard means. This promotes accessibility from a variety of devices, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.

3. **Resource Pooling:**
   Cloud providers pool their computing resources, serving multiple consumers in a multi-tenant model. Resources are assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand, optimizing efficiency and utilization.

4. **Rapid Elasticity:**
   Cloud resources can be flexibly provisioned and released, allowing businesses to scale both outward and inward to meet changing demand. This provides the appearance of unlimited capabilities to the consumer.

5. **Measured Service:**
   Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging metering capabilities. This enables the monitoring, control, and reporting of resource usage, promoting transparency for both providers and consumers.
